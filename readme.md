## Summery
This is project made for all Elite Dangerous lovers out there.
You should be able to after the initial road map is complete atleast, 
to gauge ur status and other important information just from lights flashing from ur keyboard.
This should bring awesomeness into immersion and some more customisability to your games play.

you can customize ur ship dashboard, why not customize your whole room lighting as well ? :D

it'll be really cool, once it is atleast in Alpha, to get some feedback and even see what u guys would do with the configurations and such.
[add youtube video of poc here]
